I am an incoming PhD student in [linguistics at the University of Washington](https://linguistics.washington.edu/). My research interest lies in the intersection between semantics and computational linguistics. Prior to joining UW, I was at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where I worked on natural language processing under the supervision of [Prof. Kai-Wei Chang](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~kwchang/).

You can find my CV [here](/files/CV_7_24.pdf) (last updated 7/2024).
